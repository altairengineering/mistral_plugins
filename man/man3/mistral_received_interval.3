.SH NAME
mistral_received_interval \- Function called on receipt of an interval
message
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

.sp
.BI "void mistral_received_interval(mistral_plugin *" plugin ");"
.fi

Link with \fI\-pthread\fP.

.SH DESCRIPTION
If this function is defined when linking with \fBplugin_control.o\fP
it will be called when an interval message is received from Mistral.
.LP
This function is only called for update plug-ins and will be received
before any data blocks are sent.
.LP
The \fIplugin\fP structure as defined in \fI"mistral_plugin.h"\fP will
contain the following members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsem_t     \fPlock;
\fBuint64_t  \fPinterval;
\fBuint8_t   \fPtype;
\fBFILE     *\fPerror_log;
.fi
.RE
.LP
As the contents of this structure are shared between threads in
\fBplugin_control.o\fP access to any structure members must not be
attempted until a call to \fBsem_wait\fP(3) or a similar function that
can take the \fBlock\fP structure member as a parameter has successfully
completed.
.LP
This \fIinterval\fP value is for information only and will be set to the
period in seconds Mistral will wait between calls to an update plug-in
at the time of this function call.
.LP
If the period between calls to the plug-in is important to the correct
functioning of the plug-in the passed pointer \fIplugin\fP or value of
the structure member \fIinterval\fP should be saved by this function.
.LP
If a call to \fBmistral_shutdown\fP(3) is made by this function then
\fBplugin_control.o\fP will perform a clean plug-in shutdown on its
return.
