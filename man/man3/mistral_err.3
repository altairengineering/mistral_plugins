.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmistral_err()\fP function will produce output according to a
\fIformat\fP as described in the man page for \fBvfprintf\fP(3).
.LP
Output will be sent to the file stream specified for the plug-in as
described in \fBmistral_startup\fP(3).
If the file stream is set to \fIstderr\fP the function will attempt
to append a trailing newline character (\(aq\en\(aq) to the message
if one is not present as this is required for correct processing by
Mistral.
No error will be reported if appending the newline character fails, the
message will simply be written to the file stream unchanged.
.sp
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters
printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
